                            Internet is a connection of various computer networks in a global level following a standard internet protocol. The various types of network present today are public, private, government, academic and business network. Internet technology refers to the connection of different devices to receive and send information through the internet. It is responsible for making the world a smaller place. The technology plays a vital role in today's date and time. Everything we do from the alarm we set for the morning to the time we look in our phones to the pictures that we click to show off out day on the internet, everything is technology. We have become so much adapted to the technology in the current time that it feels like we cannot function without it. But everything has its good aspects and bad aspects.

                        <h3>Positive impacts:</h3><br>
                            <p>     
                            The internet provides us with entertainment, social interaction, exchange of information, shopping, managing homes, historical data etc. Much easier than it was a couple of years ago. The internet technology has helped us to perform our work more efficiently. With a use of a button we can order foods, buy things, get a cab, know birthdays, share our moments to the person living miles away from us. It has made our lives more convenient. 
                            <br><br>
                            Learning is also enhanced by the technology. Websites like skill share, tutorial point, and w3schools offer tutorials for us to learn. This is a new way of learning. We can learn various skills at the comfort of our home. In a time where skill is valued more than education levels this is a game changing platform. A Google classroom is another positive aspect of the technology. It is a platform where students and teachers interact online and discuss a subject matter. We no longer have to wait for the class timing to ask teacher a question we can simply ask it online and get an answer as soon as possible or we can just Google for a direct and fast answers online. We no longer have to go through various encyclopedias to learn about stuffs. The way we receive news has also evolved with the internet. We no longer have to wait for a certain time to listen to or watch news. We can find about the news as soon as possible, thanks to digital media. Digital media has helped  us receive news about anything from anywhere in the world within a matter of minutes.

                        <h3>Negative impacts:</h3><br>
                            <p>
                            With convenience, it has also brought a fair share of risks. People today have adapted to using internet so much that they store all their information online which has made it easier for online scammers to use the information to use it against them. Cyber bulling, scamming, identity theft, loss of data, ransom ware etc have become easier to perform and more commonly found crimes these days. The social media is also creating some negative impact to us. It is leading us to social anxiety and other mental disorders. These problems are occurring because we are focusing more on showing the world rather than living the life. Obesity is another main problem of this generation. As we can get everything on the internet we have less outdoor activities. Kids would rather play mobile games than play football. They are technology dependent from a very small age, which also affects their growth. The internet also stores all our information like contacts, emails, birthdays etc. Which in return is weakening our memory.

                            Analyzing the pros and cons of the internet technology, internet technology is a blessing if we use it wisely and responsibly. The things that we get from the internet like, learning skills, acceleration of communication, communicating  in long distance, the convenience that we get from the comfort of home etc easily outnumber the little cons the internet has to offer. If we control how we use the internet and be careful about what information we share on the internet, we can minimize the cons like identity theft, loss of data, cyber bullying, ransom ware etc. We should also be self aware that we cannot live our lives on the internet and we should be spending times outdoors and interact people in real life. The children should  also be allowed to participate in extra-curricular activities while in school hours as they spend maximum of their time in school. We should not limit them to books and studies only.
